          <li> Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
<li> GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
<li> A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. </li>
<li> GitHub Issues are a task management tool in the repository that helps us keep track of our progress.</li>
<li> We can use Markdown language to add our Issue description. We use # and ## for heading 1 and heading 2 texts.</li>
<li> GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The default branch is called main. We should not do any coding directly in the main branch.</li>
<li> We will branch off of main and create a feature branch.</li>
<li> To check what branch we are currently in, we type git status in the command line.</li>
<li> To create a new branch we type git checkout -b branch-name in the command line.</li>
<li> To create a feature branch, we type git checkout -b feature/branch-name in the command line.</li>
