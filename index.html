          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
<li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
<li> Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users</li>
<li> Inside the head element, we can use metadata tags: title, style, base, link, meta, script.</li>
<li> An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>

<li> The body element contains HTML elements.</li>
<li> These nested elements inside the body are called child elements.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
 <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
 <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
 <li> When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a (link) element placed in the HTML's <head> </li>
 <li> A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply. </li>
 <li> Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. </li>
 <li> Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. </li>
 <li> Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code. </li>
 <li> When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. To do this, we will use the HTML (link) element. </li>
 <li> Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
<li> GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
<li> A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. </li>
<li> GitHub Issues are a task management tool in the repository that helps us keep track of our progress.</li>
<li> We can use Markdown language to add our Issue description. We use # and ## for heading 1 and heading 2 texts.</li>
<li> GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The default branch is called main. We should not do any coding directly in the main branch.</li>
<li> We will branch off of main and create a feature branch.</li>
<li> To check what branch we are currently in, we type git status in the command line.</li>
<li> To create a new branch we type git checkout -b branch-name in the command line.</li>
<li> To create a feature branch, we type git checkout -b feature/branch-name in the command line.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to websites. </li>
<li> A variable is a named container that allows us to store different data types in our code: String, Number, Boolean, Arry, Object. </li> 
<li> Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. </li>
<li> Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. </li>
<li> An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
<li> Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. </li>
<li> We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed. </li>
<li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. </li>
<li> Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, not all arrays must have multiple data types. </li>
<li> A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
<li> A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. </li>
<li> To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute. </li>
