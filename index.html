<li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
<li> Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users</li>
<li> Inside the head element, we can use metadata tags: title, style, base, link, meta, script.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. </li>
 <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
 <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
 <li> When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a (link) element placed in the HTML's <head> </li>
 <li> A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply. </li>
 <li> Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. </li>
 <li> Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. </li>
 <li> Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code. </li>
 <li> When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. To do this, we will use the HTML (link) element. </li>
 <li> Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. </li>

        <ul>
          <li> Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
<li> GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
<li> A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. </li>
<li> GitHub Issues are a task management tool in the repository that helps us keep track of our progress.</li>
<li> We can use Markdown language to add our Issue description. We use # and ## for heading 1 and heading 2 texts.</li>
<li> GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The default branch is called main. We should not do any coding directly in the main branch.</li>
<li> We will branch off of main and create a feature branch.</li>
<li> To check what branch we are currently in, we type git status in the command line.</li>
<li> To create a new branch we type git checkout -b branch-name in the command line.</li>
<li> To create a feature branch, we type git checkout -b feature/branch-name in the command line.</li>
