# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
The project was built to help students access and learn a few facts about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
As this was my first project, I was motivated to learn about these topics myself and get familiarised with them.
By bringing all the information about the topics in one place, the project makes it easy for a student to access or check the content whenever they need it.
By building this project, I've learned how to use the command line, how to connect my local environment to the GitHub repository, the importance of debugging, how HTML structures a page, how to complete the git flow, how to create a CSS file and link it to the HTML, and what is JavaScript and how to use it.
